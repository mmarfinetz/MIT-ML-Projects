```

## üìä Results Summary

| Project | Best Model | Performance Metric | Score |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Used Car Pricing | Linear Regression | R¬≤ (test) | 0.868 |
| Boston Housing | Multiple Regression | R¬≤ | TBD |
| Classification ML | Random Forest | Accuracy | TBD |
| Classification PDS | Ensemble | F1-Score | TBD |
| Time Series | ARIMA | RMSE | TBD |
| Unsupervised | K-Means | Silhouette | TBD |
| SVHN | CNN | Accuracy | TBD |

## üìù Key Learnings

1. **Feature importance varies by domain** - In used car pricing, power and year were critical; in housing, location and square footage dominate
2. **No single algorithm fits all** - Linear models excel with linear relationships, while tree-based methods handle non-linearity
3. **Data quality matters** - Proper preprocessing and feature engineering often improve performance more than algorithm selection
4. **Business context is crucial** - The best model isn't always the most complex; interpretability and actionability matter
