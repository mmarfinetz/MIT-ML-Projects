# Used Car Price Prediction - Regression Analysis

## üìã Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive pricing model for used cars in the Indian market using various regression techniques. With the used car market surpassing new car sales in India, accurate pricing models are crucial for both buyers and sellers.

## üéØ Business Context

The Indian used car market presents unique challenges:
- Unlike new cars with deterministic OEM pricing, used cars have high price variability
- Multiple factors influence pricing beyond standard specifications
- Market is rapidly growing with shifting consumer preferences
- Sellers struggle to set competitive yet profitable prices

## üîç Problem Statement

**Objective:** Build a model that accurately predicts used car prices to enable:
- Data-driven pricing strategies
- Market competitiveness
- Profitable business operations
- Customer trust through transparent pricing

## üìä Dataset Description

- **Size:** 7,253 records with 13 features
- **Target Variable:** Price (in Indian Rupees)
- **Time Period:** Cars from 1996-2019

### Features:
| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Year | Integer | Manufacturing year |
| Kilometers_Driven | Integer | Total distance traveled |
| Name | Object | Car model and variant |
| Location | Object | City (11 unique cities) |
| Fuel_Type | Object | Diesel, Petrol, CNG, LPG, Electric |
| Transmission | Object | Manual or Automatic |
| Owner_Type | Object | First, Second, Third, Fourth & Above |
| Mileage | Float | Fuel efficiency (km/l) |
| Engine | Float | Engine capacity (cc) |
| Power | Float | Engine power (bhp) |
| Seats | Float | Seating capacity |
| New_Price | Float | Original showroom price |

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Distribution Analysis:** Identified right-skewed distributions requiring log transformation
- **Correlation Analysis:** Discovered strong correlations between Power-Price (0.77) and Engine-Price (0.69)
- **Missing Value Treatment:** Imputed using median for numerical features
- **Outlier Detection:** Applied IQR method for anomaly detection

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Log Transformation:** Applied to Kilometers_Driven and Price for normalization
- **Brand Extraction:** Created 'Brand' feature from car names
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converted categorical variables
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features

### 3. Model Development & Comparison

|-------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Linear Regression** | 0.9399 | **0.8688** | 2.738 | **4.037** | Best overall performance |
| Ridge Regression | 0.9330 | 0.8878 | 2.892 | 3.733 | Good regularization |
| Decision Tree | 0.9991 | 0.8045 | 0.340 | 4.927 | Overfitting evident |
| Decision Tree (Tuned) | 0.8122 | 0.8781 | 4.842 | 3.891 | Better generalization |
| Random Forest | 0.9756 | 0.8568 | 1.745 | 4.218 | Robust ensemble |

## üèÜ Key Findings

### Most Important Features (in order):
1. **Power** (0.609 importance) - Engine power directly correlates with value
2. **Year** (0.232 importance) - Newer cars command higher prices
3. **Engine** (0.046 importance) - Engine capacity affects pricing
4. **Kilometers_Driven_Log** (0.016 importance) - Lower mileage increases value

### Market Insights:
- Cars in **Coimbatore and Bangalore** command highest prices
- Cars in **Kolkata** are typically cheapest
- **Manual transmission** dominates the market (71.8%)
- **First owner** vehicles represent 82.1% of listings
- Median car year is 2014, showing preference for relatively newer used cars

## üí° Business Recommendations

1. **Adopt Linear Regression Model** for production due to:
   - Best balance of accuracy and interpretability
   - Lower computational requirements
   - Easier to explain to stakeholders

2. **Pricing Strategy Focus:**
   - Prioritize Power and Year in valuation
   - Adjust pricing by location (premium for Bangalore/Coimbatore)
   - Consider owner history as significant factor

3. **Market Opportunities:**
   - Target 2012-2016 models (sweet spot for value)
   - Focus on first-owner vehicles
   - Premium pricing for low-mileage, high-power vehicles

## üìà Model Performance Visualization

The linear regression model shows:
- Consistent performance across price ranges
- Minimal bias in predictions
- Good generalization to unseen data
- R¬≤ of 0.87 indicates 87% of price variance explained

## üöÄ Future Improvements

1. **Feature Enhancement:**
   - Add service history data
   - Include accident/insurance claim history
   - Incorporate market demand indicators

2. **Model Enhancements:**
   - Experiment with gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Implement stacking ensemble
   - Add time-series components for market trends

3. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - Build REST API for real-time predictions
   - Create web interface for sellers
   - Implement A/B testing framework

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Requirements:
```python
pandas==1.3.0
